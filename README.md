# Random-Name-Picker
This is a project originally designed for a school project. It allows the user to add names to a Python list and then gives them a random name back. This was written for Python 3.7 and may not fully work with previous versions as that hasn't been tested.
Please note that this is not a fully developed program and will have more features added in the future.
